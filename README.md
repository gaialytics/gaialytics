# Hi there! 🤙🏻 I'm Gaia! @gaialytics
I am a <b>web marketing specialist</b> with a specialization in <b>Analytics</b>.🎓

I have a background in the <b>humanities</b>: I have a bachelor's degree in Languages and Cultures for Publishing and a master's degree in Publishing and Journalism.

Being passionate about computer science and technology for as long as I can remember, my love for data emerged during my university courses, where I discovered the perfect synergy between data and journalism.

In fact...
### I'm wannabe data journalist! 😎

After completing my master's degree, I pursued a specialization in <b>web marketing</b> at a digital marketing school and carried out a transmedia project within the field of investigative journalism (the subject of my master degree thesis). During my time at the digital marketing school, I interned in the <b>Web Analytics</b> department, eventually becoming an assistant coach. 👩🏻‍🏫

I also attended a Data Analytics training course where I strengthened my analytical approach and learned new programming languages. 📊

Over the years, I have always worked in the communication, tourism, and digital marketing fields.

I'm constantly curious and I will go on to study and learn new skills.
